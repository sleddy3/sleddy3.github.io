                <h2>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
                <p>Dungeons and Dragons is a table top role playing game. It is lead by someone called the dungeon master who creates a world for the players characters to go through. This is a game played through speech, paper, and dice. The dice are used to mimic realistic chance like in real life, so that the players can't just do whatever.</p>
                <p>Dungeons and Dragons came out in the 70s and was breifly popular. In recent it has began to pick up on popularity again due to podcasts like critical role. I think it's a great game that helps build creative thinking.</p>

                <h2>Who plays Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
                <p>Though a lot of people see it as a nerdy boy game, it is a game for anyone. If you are interested in fantasy, action, story telling, this is the game for you!</p>
                <p>I personally have played this game. My sisters have. My cousins and friends of all genders, races, and ages 12 and up have. Any person who can think and imagine, can play this game.</p>

            <section id="when">
                <h2>When is Dungeons and Dragons Played?</h2>
                <p>Dungeons and Dragons can be played whenever. Any time from 12am to 12pm. As long as everyone playing is in agreeance about the time.</p>
                <p>When I host Dungeons and Dragons sessions, I typically host them late at night. I choose to host them at a latter time because all the people I play with are night owls and are done with all work and activity's for the day.</p>

                <h2>Where is Dungeons and Dragons Played?</h2>
                <p>Dungeons and Dragons can really be played anywhere that there's space and is decently dry. All you need to play is an ability to communicate, dice, and character sheets. As long as you have the room for people and the material you are set!</p>
                <p>When I host a session I typically will use a large table or a open floor in a more private room of the house. I choose that location because of the space and because if we are being loud it won't bother people not playing.</p>

            <section id="how">
                <h2>How do you Play Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
                <p>First you need the materials. All the materials needed are character sheets, pens/pencils, and dice sets. Optional materials that make it easier/better, would be the starter books and maybe a module to start off.</p>
                <p>Once you have the stuff you need someone to be the dungeon master. The dugeon master is the story teller/host of the game. They can either come up with their own story or use a premade story/module. From there the dungeon master will verbally describe the world the players characters are in. From there the players choose what they want to do and say what they want to say, and the dungeon master describes the outcome of those choices and words. The dice are rolled when fighting or when attempting a action. The resulting number can either tell if the action was excuted well or at all, or if a attack landed and the amount of damage that it dealt.</p>

            <section id="why">
                <h2>Why play Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
                <p>I believe people should play dungeons and dragons because it is for one a very fun game. I also believe it helps build a persons ability to be creative. I think it also helps people strengthen their story telling ability.</p>
                <p>Since playing I personally have seen improvement in my story telling ability, my leadership skills, and my ability to generate creative ideas. I also have made core memmories playing this game that has given me inexplicable joy. I really do recommend this game to everyone. I think people should at least try to play it once. If you do, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</p>
