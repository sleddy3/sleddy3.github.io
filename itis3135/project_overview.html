            <header>Dynamic Functionality on the website</header>
            <p><strong>Hyperlinks:</strong> I plan to use hyperlinks to navigate between pages. Homepage will have hyperlinks to "Datatypes and Variables", "Operators", "Control Structures", "Functions" and "DataStructures". The five pages that branch from homepage wil have hyperlinks to "Homepage" and their respective subpages. The subpages will have only a singular hyperlink to go back to their parent page.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Kind of like this but not quite. <a href="https://www.metrica.us/">Example</a></p>
            <p><strong>Buttons:</strong> On all the subpages I plan to have either multiple choice questions or written response questions. When the check button is clicked it will check if the answer written or submitted is correct or not.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Like the learn activity on Quizlet. <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Example</a></p>
