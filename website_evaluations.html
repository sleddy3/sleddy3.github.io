                <h3><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Good Website</a></h3>
                <p class="description">This website is for the music streaming service Spotify. When you open the website without an account, it shows you the actions you can take once you have an acount on the left and popular artists and albums it has on the right. It is laid out in a visual appealing way that advertises the functionality of this streaming service over others.</p>
                <ul class="crap">
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Uses black and gray background colors with a white font, which is great for contrast. The black and gray background colors also make the album covers and artist images pop out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Keeps a strong repetion of coloring, spacing, sectioning, and overall display across the page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Everything on the page is well aligned. Spacing is good and helps differentiate between sections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>The grouping of the sections is well done. The top bar is for navigating. The left side is the users library. The right is the music and artists. All these are sectioned very well.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Bad Website</a></h3>
                <p class="description">This website is for the Yale School of Arts. This website is the hub for all Yale School of Arts information, links, and events. The website is laid out in a way I can't describe, other than it has a breif description, a calendar of events, links to other pages, and contact information.</p>
                <ul class="crap">
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>There are so many colors that are clashing. Nothing stands out because it is all colored or highlighted. Very visually noisy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>There is some repetion but not anything that visually stands out. The format is mainly random. Not much consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Looks like the website is defaultly aligned. everything is on the left with no consistency. Nothing is aligned with one another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>The grouping is not done well at all. It is dificult to tell which information should be with which. The only good sectioning is the links tab.</li>
